# Master Turtle

A unified turtle program pack for ComputerCraft / CC:Tweaked: Daniel's
turtle programs plus Inksaver's GUI toolkit, behind one launcher menu,
with crash-proof resume on the long runners and an updater that pulls
from this repo.

Two trees, pick the one matching your Minecraft version:

- `1.12.x/` for Minecraft 1.12.2 (classic ComputerCraft)
- `1.20.x/` for Minecraft 1.20+ (CC:Tweaked)

Both trees ship the same programs. The only difference: `1.20.x` also
includes `tk3.lua` (Inksaver's classic GUI toolkit), which needs modern
peripheral APIs. Note for 1.20.x: modern CC:Tweaked runs Lua 5.2 and
removed the old `disable_lua51_features` config toggle entirely; the
pack handles 5.2 internally (the quarry shims the 5.1 functions it
needs), so there is nothing to configure.

## Install

On a fresh turtle or computer, fetch the updater for your version
with wget (HTTP must be enabled in your ComputerCraft config), then run
it. It downloads every file from this repo and only replaces files that
are older than the download.

Minecraft 1.12.2:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaniCePe/Master-Turtle/main/1.12.x/updater.lua updater
updater
```

Minecraft 1.20+:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaniCePe/Master-Turtle/main/1.20.x/updater.lua updater
updater
```

(After the first install, just run `updater` to update.)

The updater installs to the current directory. It never touches your
save files (`Civil_Quarry_Restore`, `.platformer_restore`, etc.) or the
quarry's `startup` resume stub.

## Quick start

Reboot the turtle. The launcher menu appears (via `startup.lua`):

- Up/Down moves, Enter runs, Q quits. Mouse works on advanced computers.
- Programs that need dimensions show a prompt first; fill in what you
  know and leave the rest blank (the program will ask).
- Entries tagged `[LOOP]` run until you stop them: press Q or Ctrl+T.
  The stop is graceful; long runners save their progress so you can
  resume later.
- When a program exits you return to the menu.

You can also run any program directly from the shell, e.g.
`quarry -dim 16 16 10` or `platformer -length 20 -width 12 -mode walls`.

## Programs

### Quarry

`quarry`: the massive variable-size quarry (civilwargeeky's lineage,
Daniel's working copy v3.6.4.5). Digs a rectangular pit, sorts ores,
returns home when done or when out of fuel.

Dimensions: `-dim [length] [width] [height]`, e.g.
`quarry -dim 16 16 10`. Without it, the quarry prompts.

Full option flags (same names as the original design):

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-dim L W H` | quarry size in blocks |
| `-default` | skip all prompts, use defaults |
| `-invert [t/f]` | quarry upward instead of downward |
| `-oreQuarry [t/f]` | mine only ores, ignore common blocks |
| `-oldOreQuarry [t/f]` | legacy ore detection |
| `-blacklist [file]` | extra blocks to treat as non-ore |
| `-restore` / `-resume` | resume from the save file |
| `-autoResume` | reinstall the `startup` stub and resume on boot |
| `-atChest` | tell a resuming turtle it is already at home |
| `-chest [side]` | drop-off chest side (top/bottom/front/left/right) |
| `-enderChest [true\|slot]` | use an ender chest for drop-off |
| `-doRefuel [t/f]` | burn found coal/planks for fuel |
| `-doCheckFuel [t/f]` | check fuel usage as it digs |
| `-uniqueExtras [n]` | inventory slots reserved for low-stack items |
| `-rednet [t/f]` | rednet progress reports |
| `-sendChannel` / `-receiveChannel [n]` | rednet channels |
| `-GPS [force]` | use GPS for position on resume |
| `-startY [n]` | current Y, for bedrock detection |
| `-startupRename` / `-startupName [file]` | manage the resume stub |
| `-extraDropItems` | drop listed extra items |
| `-dumpCompareItems [t/f]` | dump before comparing chests |

Resume: the quarry writes `Civil_Quarry_Restore` as it works and can
restart exactly where it left off after a reboot or crash, with no GPS
and no extra mods. See "Resume" below. While a quarry run is active it
installs an extensionless `startup` stub that takes boot precedence and
auto-resumes (with a 5-second abort window); when our `startup.lua`
boots without that stub but finds the save, it offers the resume.

Note: the quarry uses classic Lua environment functions. On newer
CC:Tweaked, set `disable_lua51_features = false` in the mod config or
the quarry will not load.

### Platformer (builder)

`platformer`: was a floor clearer, now a real builder (v6.1). Lays
blocks in a rectangle, one layer at a time, snake pattern.

Options (CLI args or interactive prompts, quarry-style):

- `-length N` `-width N`: footprint, `-height N`: layers (default 1)
- `-mode M`: `floor` (solid slab), `walls` (perimeter only),
  `solid` (everything), `hollow` (solid top and bottom, walls between),
  `roof` (see below)
- `-inverted`: build downward from the turtle instead of upward

Roof mode: the turtle starts at any level. Give `-height N` as blocks-up;
the turtle ascends N blocks, lays one flat roof over the footprint, then
descends back to its start. With `-inverted`, it places the ceiling
upward from the start level instead (no climbing).

Examples: a 20x12 wall ring 4 high:
`platformer -length 20 -width 12 -mode walls -height 4`.
A hollow 8x8x5 room: `platformer -length 8 -width 8 -mode hollow -height 5`.
A 16x16 floor: `platformer -length 16 -width 16 -mode floor`.
A roof 6 blocks up over 10x10: `platformer -length 10 -width 10 -mode roof -height 6`.

Resume: progress is saved per layer to `.platformer_restore`; a run
interrupted mid-build resumes on the layer it left off. A `startup`
stub auto-resumes on boot (5-second abort window).

### Cropper (auto farmer)

`cropper`: farms a crop field: harvests mature crops, replants,
deposits to a chest behind it. Args: `-length N -width N` (field size),
or it prompts. Resume via `.cropper_restore`.

### Cluster scanner

`cluster`: AE2 quartz cluster scanner. Walks a grid breaking stone to
expose certus quartz. Args: `-length N -width N -wait N` (wait seconds
between sweeps). Runs until stopped.

### Filler

`filler`: fills a volume with falling blocks (sand/gravel). Args:
`-length N -width N`, or it prompts. Resume via `.filler_restore`.

### Vacuum

`vacuum`: floor sweeper: walks a grid sucking up loose items.
Args: `-length N -width N`, or it prompts. Runs until stopped.

### TRMP (trump)

`trump`: layered wall builder, snake pattern. Args: `-length N`
(wall length, X), `-height N`, `-depth N` (thickness), or it prompts.

### Framer

`framer`: builds a hollow room shell (or edge frame) of size N.
Arg: `-size N`, or it prompts.

### ChopChop, Cranker, Attacker, Cobble miner

`chopchop`: chops trees, replants saplings. Runs until stopped.
`cranker`: turns a crank (e.g. Create mod). Runs until stopped.
`attack`: auto-attacks mobs; prompts for weapon and refuel options.
Runs until stopped.
`cobble`: infinite cobble miner; dumps to chests. Runs until stopped.

### Refuelers and utilities

`buckRef`: refuels from any filled bucket (lava, etc.).
`lavaRefuel`: refuels while parked on a lava lake.
`flint`: turns gravel into flint.
`go`: interactive WASD turtle driver.
`data`: inspects the block/item in front, above, or below.
`b`/`d`/`f`/`u`: move back/down/forward/up N blocks; add any second
arg to dig through, e.g. `f 10 d`. `f` also takes `+`/`-` to dig
above/below while moving.
`l`/`r`: turn left/right N times. `p`: place block. `x`: dig.

### Toolkit v3 (1.20.x only)

`tk3`: Inksaver's classic GUI toolkit: build projects (tree farm,
spawner farm, quarry, tunnels, etc.) from a menu. Needs 1.20+.

### AI Chat (optional)

`cc-ai`: chat with an AI from the turtle (RareMojo/cc-ai, MIT). Needs
the Python server running somewhere reachable; see
`optional/cc-ai/SERVER_SETUP.md`. First run walks through setup.

### Updater

`updater`: reinstalls/updates this pack from GitHub. Run it after a
release to pull the latest.

## Resume

Long runners save progress so a reboot or crash does not lose work:

- `quarry`: `Civil_Quarry_Restore` (full state snapshot; the crown
  jewel, preserved exactly as Daniel had it). Resume with
  `quarry -resume`, or let the `startup` stub do it on boot.
- `platformer`: `.platformer_restore` (per-layer progress).
- `filler`: `.filler_restore`. `cropper`: `.cropper_restore`.
  `cluster`: `.cluster_restore`.

All but the quarry share `lib/Resume.lua`: save a table, load it back,
install/remove a `startup` stub that re-runs the program with `-resume`
after a 5-second abort window. The quarry keeps its own original
resume code untouched.

## Dimensions

Programs whose working size depends on your build ask for it at start,
either as command-line args or interactively: quarry (`-dim`),
platformer (`-length -width -height -mode -inverted`), cropper,
cluster, filler, vacuum (`-length -width`), trump
(`-length -height -depth`), framer (`-size`). The launcher prompts for
these before running.

Programs with fixed-by-mechanics sizes stay hardcoded: `flint` (one
gravel at a time), `buckRef`/`lavaRefuel` (the turtle's own fuel tank),
`go`/`data` (single interaction), movement commands (you give N each
time).
